# MVC_school_project
A Model View Controller application that enables user interraction and communication with a database.
### Dependencies 
ASP.NET and a MySQL database containing the tables and procedures provided in the SQL folder.
#### OBS. The naming of the different components is in swenglish since the provided database diagram was in Swedish. Seemed convenient at the time but now not so much.
